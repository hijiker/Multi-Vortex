Dear Mr. Sharma,

I am appending the code I just wrote for the problem. It runs fast 
enough that I can treat 10000 vortices and 2000 timesteps in about 1 s 
on my laptop.

I recommend that you look at the jupyter notebook .ipynb to be able to 
play interactively with the parameters. I have done so and already 
learned a lot about what happens if I change something.

I also tested three different vortex models and found the simple 1/r 
most promising (see code). However I did not fit the results for E11 and 
E22 to what the von Karman model gives, so I have no idea yet if this is 
really usable.

Please feel free to use and extend  the code to make progress on the 
statistical model.

Best regards,

Ennes Sarradj

P.S.: I noticed that you still use Python 2. I would recommend to 
upgrade to Python 3.
